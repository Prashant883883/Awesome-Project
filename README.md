<h1>My experience on the SCRUM Project</h1>
<h2>My experience on the scrum project was quite new as well as amazing. I get to know more about the topic and i was also amazed to see how much we could acomplished as a team when we all brought our unique ideas and strength.One of the thing that fascinates me was about the factor that we had to consider for getting the desired result to our projects.I also enjoyed the creative aspects, like designing the map and collecting all the necessary informaton from the user stories so that we wouldn't miss anything. My team members were very supportive as they were helping me through out the project . </h2>
<h2>I was completely blank at the very first glance when i see the project because it was completely new for me . Even the word SCRUM was new for me . However,after my lecturer, Mira, described about the topic in more depth, i felt like , "I'm getting now".What i admire mostly is the support of my team members in collecting the details from the user stories and to arrange them so as to acquire the desired output.</h2>
